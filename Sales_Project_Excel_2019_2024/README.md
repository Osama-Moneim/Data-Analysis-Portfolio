Sales Performance Analysis Report (2019–2024) 
Executive Summary  
This report presents a comprehensive sales performance analysis for the period 2019–2024. It evaluates 
revenue growth, profitability, and return behavior, performance across categories, and regions. 
Key KPIs Overview 
• Total Revenue: $17.839M 
• Total Cost: $12.491M 
• Total Orders: 7000 
• Total Profit: $ 5.349M 
• Total Quantity: 45,315 Units 
• Total Return Orders: 1,751 
• Total Returned Quantity: 11,175 Units  
• Transaction Impact Rate: 3.86%  
• Unit Return Rate: 24.66%  
Profitability Analysis (The "Profit Gap") 
• While Total Profit is $5.349M, the current Profit Margin of 29.98% is currently 2.02% below the 
corporate target of 32%. 
• Office Supplies and Furniture are the strongest categories, both maintaining profit margins 
above 30%. 
• This gap indicates that operational inefficiencies—primarily driven by returns—are preventing 
the company from converting revenue growth into target-level profitability. 
Return Behavior 
• The unit return rate of 24.66% exceeds the target return rate of 22% by 2.66 percentage points, 
contributing directly to the profit margin shortfall. 
Growth Trends 
• Despite year-to-year volatility, the overall revenue trend remains positive, resulting in a 
cumulative YoY growth of 20.30%. 
Analyst Recommendation  
• Office Supplies is our most valuable category, leading in both revenue ($6.07M) and profit 
margin (30.07%). However, its high return rate of 25.66% is the primary reason the company is 
missing its overall return target of 22%. If we can reduce returns in this specific category, it 
would significantly boost our already strong total profit of $5.349M. 
• Targeted return reduction initiatives such as supplier quality checks, product description 
improvements, or return policy adjustments should be prioritized for Office Supplies.
